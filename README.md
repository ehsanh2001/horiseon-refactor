# Refactoring Horiseon Website

## Description

This repository showcases the refactored code for the Horiseon website, aligning with accessibility standards. The CSS stylesheet has been meticulously organized, contributing to a well-optimized and fast-loading site.

The refactoring process is divided into three key components:

- ### HTML file

    - Replaced generic div elements with appropriate HTML semantic elements.
    - Added descriptive alt text for images.

- ### CSS file

    - Restructured selectors to follow a more organized hierarchy, prioritizing from the most general to the least specific.
    - Consolidated selectors to enhance code readability and maintainability.

- ### Image files

    - Adjusted image sizes to match the dimensions used on the website, thereby improving overall page loading speed.
